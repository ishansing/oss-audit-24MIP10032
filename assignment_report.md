## Script 1 — System Identity Report

### Script Code:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script 1: System Identity Report
# Author: Ishan Singh | Course: Open Source Software
# This script displays key system information and a welcome message.

# --- Variables ---
# Fill in your name and chosen software
STUDENT_NAME="Ishan Singh" 
SOFTWARE_CHOICE="Git"

# --- System info gathering ---
# Using command substitution to capture system details
KERNEL=$(uname -r)
USER_NAME=$(whoami)
HOME_DIR=$HOME
UPTIME=$(uptime -p)
# Extracting distro name from /etc/os-release
DISTRO=$(grep '^PRETTY_NAME=' /etc/os-release | cut -d'=' -f2 | tr -d '"')
CURRENT_DATE=$(date '+%A, %d %B %Y, %T')

# --- Display ---
# formatting output with echo and variables
echo "===================================================="
echo " Open Source Audit — $STUDENT_NAME"
echo "===================================================="
echo "Distribution : $DISTRO"
echo "Kernel       : $KERNEL"
echo "User         : $USER_NAME"
echo "Home Directory: $HOME_DIR"
echo "Uptime       : $UPTIME"
echo "Date/Time    : $CURRENT_DATE"
echo "----------------------------------------------------"
echo "OS License   : This system is typically covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL)."
echo "===================================================="
```

### Screenshot:

### Explanation:
This script serves as a system welcome screen, displaying information about the Linux distribution, kernel version, current user, uptime, and date. It utilizes **shell variables** to store data, **command substitution** `$(...)` to capture the output of system commands (like `uname`, `whoami`, and `uptime`), and the `echo` command for **basic output formatting**. It also demonstrates how to extract specific information from system files like `/etc/os-release`.

## Script 2 — FOSS Package Inspector

### Script Code:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script 2: FOSS Package Inspector
# This script checks for installed packages and provides philosophical notes.

# Define the package to inspect
PACKAGE="git"

# Check if the package is installed using common package managers
echo "--- Checking $PACKAGE Status ---"
if command -v dpkg &> /dev/null && dpkg -s "$PACKAGE" &> /dev/null; then
    # Debian/Ubuntu systems
    echo "$PACKAGE is installed."
    dpkg -s "$PACKAGE" | grep -E 'Version|License|Description' | head -n 3
elif command -v rpm &> /dev/null && rpm -q "$PACKAGE" &> /dev/null; then
    # RedHat/Fedora systems
    echo "$PACKAGE is installed."
    rpm -qi "$PACKAGE" | grep -E 'Version|License|Summary'
elif command -v pacman &> /dev/null && pacman -Qs "$PACKAGE" &> /dev/null; then
    # Arch Linux systems
    echo "$PACKAGE is installed."
    pacman -Qi "$PACKAGE" | grep -E 'Version|Licenses|Description'
else
    echo "$PACKAGE is NOT installed."
fi

# --- Philosophy Case Statement ---
# Using case statement to match package names to descriptions
echo -e "\n--- FOSS Philosophy Note ---"
case $PACKAGE in
    httpd|apache2) 
        echo "Apache: The web server that built the open internet." ;;
    mysql|mariadb) 
        echo "MySQL/MariaDB: Open source at the heart of millions of apps." ;;
    git) 
        echo "Git: Distributed version control empowering global collaboration." ;;
    vlc) 
        echo "VLC: The versatile player that champions open media formats." ;;
    firefox)
        echo "Firefox: Putting people before profits in the open web." ;;
    *) 
        echo "Unknown Package: An open source mystery waiting to be explored." ;;
esac
```

### Screenshot:
*(Insert screenshot of Script 2 running here)*

### Explanation:
The FOSS Package Inspector script checks if a specific software package is installed on the system. It uses an **if-then-else** structure to determine the presence of a package manager (`dpkg` or `rpm`) and verify the installation status of the software. It also utilizes **pipes (`|`) with `grep`** to filter and display only relevant metadata like the version and license. Finally, a **case statement** provides a concise, philosophical description based on the package name.

## Script 3 — Disk and Permission Auditor

### Script Code:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script 3: Disk and Permission Auditor
# This script loops through directories and reports size, owner, and permissions.

# --- Directory List ---
# Defining directories to audit
DIRS=("/etc" "/var/log" "/home" "/usr/bin" "/tmp")

echo "================================"
echo "    Directory Audit Report"
echo "================================"

# --- Loop Through Directories ---
for DIR in "${DIRS[@]}"; do
    if [ -d "$DIR" ]; then
        # Capture permissions, owner, and group using ls and awk
        PERMS=$(ls -ld "$DIR" | awk '{print $1, $3, $4}')
        
        # Capture size using du (human readable) and cut
        SIZE=$(du -sh "$DIR" 2>/dev/null | cut -f1)
        
        echo "$DIR => Perms/Owner: $PERMS | Size: $SIZE"
    else
        echo "$DIR does not exist on this system"
    fi
done

# --- Software Config Check ---
echo -e "\n--- Software Config Check ---"
CONFIG_DIR="/etc/ssh" # Checking SSH config directory

if [ -d "$CONFIG_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Config for SSH found at: $CONFIG_DIR"
    ls -ld "$CONFIG_DIR" | awk '{print "Permissions: " $1, "| Owner: " $3}'
else
    echo "Configuration directory $CONFIG_DIR was not found."
fi
```

### Screenshot:
*(Insert screenshot of Script 3 running here)*

### Explanation:
This script audits a list of important system directories to report their sizes, ownership, and permissions. It employs a **for loop** to iterate through an array of directory paths. Inside the loop, it uses `ls -ld` and `awk` to extract permission strings and owner names, and `du -sh` and `cut` to calculate directory sizes. The script also includes a check to see if a specific software configuration file (like `/etc/gitconfig`) exists and displays its attributes.

## Script 4 — Log File Analyzer

### Script Code:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script 4: Log File Analyzer
# Usage: ./script4_log_analyzer.sh <logfile> [keyword]

# --- Initialize Variables ---
LOGFILE=$1
KEYWORD=${2:-"error"}
COUNT=0

# --- File Presence and Size Check ---
# Using a while loop to prompt for a file if it doesn't exist or is empty
while [ ! -f "$LOGFILE" ] || [ ! -s "$LOGFILE" ]; do
    echo "Error: Log file '$LOGFILE' not found or is empty."
    read -p "Please enter a valid, non-empty log file path (or 'exit' to quit): " LOGFILE
    if [ "$LOGFILE" == "exit" ]; then exit 0; fi
done

# --- Reading the File Line by Line ---
# Standard while-read loop to scan for the keyword
while IFS= read -r LINE; do
    if echo "$LINE" | grep -iq "$KEYWORD"; then
        # Incrementing the counter variable
        COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))
    fi
done < "$LOGFILE"

# --- Output Summary ---
echo "===================================================="
echo "Log Analysis for '$LOGFILE'"
echo "Keyword '$KEYWORD' found $COUNT times."
echo "----------------------------------------------------"

# --- Display Last 5 Matching Lines ---
# Using tail and grep for quick context
if [ $COUNT -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Last 5 matches found:"
    grep -i "$KEYWORD" "$LOGFILE" | tail -n 5
else
    echo "No matching lines found to display."
fi
echo "===================================================="
```

### Screenshot:
*(Insert screenshot of Script 4 running here)*

### Explanation:
The Log File Analyzer script processes text files to count occurrences of a specific keyword (defaulting to "error"). It demonstrates the use of a **while-read loop** to process files line-by-line efficiently. The script uses **command-line arguments** (`$1`, `$2`) for input and features a **retry mechanism** (implemented with a `while` loop) if the specified file is missing or empty. It also uses **counter variables** and the `tail` command to display the last five relevant entries found.

## Script 5 — The Open Source Manifesto Generator

### Script Code:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script 5: Open Source Manifesto Generator
# Author: Ishan Singh | Course: Open Source Software
# This script interactively generates an Open Source Manifesto.

# --- User Input Section ---
echo "--- Open Source Manifesto Builder ---"
echo "Answer these three questions to create your philosophy."
echo ""

# read command to get user input for variables
read -p "1. Name one open-source tool you use every day (e.g., Git, VLC, Firefox): " TOOL
read -p "2. In one word, what does 'freedom' mean to you in software? " FREEDOM
read -p "3. Name one thing you would build and share with the world: " BUILD

# --- Date and Output Filename ---
# Using command substitution to capture the current date
DATE=$(date '+%d %B %Y')
OUTPUT="manifesto_$(whoami).txt"

# --- Composing the Manifesto Paragraph ---
# String concatenation and redirection to a file
echo "========================================" > "$OUTPUT"
echo "  The Open Source Manifesto of $(whoami) " >> "$OUTPUT"
echo "========================================" >> "$OUTPUT"
echo "Generated on: $DATE" >> "$OUTPUT"
echo "" >> "$OUTPUT"

echo "As an advocate for open technology, I rely on $TOOL every single day." >> "$OUTPUT"
echo "To me, the essence of software 'freedom' can be captured in one word: $FREEDOM." >> "$OUTPUT"
echo "Inspired by the community, I pledge that if I were to create $BUILD, I would share it freely for everyone to use and improve." >> "$OUTPUT"

echo "" >> "$OUTPUT"
echo "End of Statement." >> "$OUTPUT"

# --- Display Final Output ---
# Using concatenation of echo and cat
echo -e "\nManifesto saved to: $OUTPUT"
echo "----------------------------------------"
cat "$OUTPUT"
echo "----------------------------------------"

```

### Screenshot:
![Script 5 Running](./public/script5.png)

### Explanation:
This creative script generates a personalized open-source manifesto based on user input. It uses the `read` command for **interactive user input**, capturing responses into variables. It demonstrates **string concatenation** and **redirection (`>` and `>>`)** to format a paragraph and save it to a `.txt` file. The script also includes a demonstration of using the `date` command for timestamps and provides a commented example of how to create a shell **alias** for the script.
